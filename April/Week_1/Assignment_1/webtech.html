    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
    </p>

    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript</p>

    <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web
        applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you
        click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link
        two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
        conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into
        images, tables, links, etc.
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page
        can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML
        only, we can create static web pages.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
        JavaScript.</p>

    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
        Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
        often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.
        JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.
        JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that started off simply as a mechanism to add logic and interactivity to an
        otherwise static Netscape browser. In the years since its introduction, it has not only supplanted a variety of
        other competing languages and technologies to become the standard for browser-based programming, but it has also
        expanded beyond the client space to become a dominant language on the server side, as well.</p>

    <p>Instead, JavaScript is interpreted on the fly by the computer processing it. Because JavaScript code is not
        packaged in a CPU-friendly form, such as Java bytecode or a binary executable, program execution can be slower
        than a comparable program written in Scala or F#. However, modern JavaScript engines are highly optimized, and
        inefficiencies are rarely noticeable when using modern hardware.</p>
