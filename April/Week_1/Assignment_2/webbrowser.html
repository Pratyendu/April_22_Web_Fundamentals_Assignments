    <h1>Web Browser</h1>
    <p>When we need any kind of information most of the time we get help from the Internet, and we get information. The
        Internet provides us useful information easily; we use mobile phones, computers, and tablets. We searched for a
        lot of things in our daily life, so we get information about all over the world, but we can not get information
        by just only getting connected to the Internet. We need a platform where we can search for our questions. The
        platform that provides such kinds of services is called a web browser, without a web browser internet will not
        be able to provide information.</p>

        render HTML which is used to design a webpage. Whenever we search anything on the internet, the browser loads a
        web page written in HTML, including text, links, images, and other items such as style sheets and JavaScript
