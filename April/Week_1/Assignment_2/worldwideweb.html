    <h1>World Wide Web (WWW):</h1>
    <p>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> abbreviated as WWW and commonly known as the web. The WWW was initiated by
        CERN (European library for Nuclear Research) in 1989.</p>
    <h3>History: </h3>
    <p>It is a project created, by Timothy Berner’s Lee in 1989, for researchers to work together effectively at CERN.
        is an organization, named World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which was developed for further development in the
        web. This organization is directed by Tim Berner’s Lee, aka the father of the web.</p>
    <h3>System Architecture: </h3>
    <p>From the user’s point of view, the web consists of a vast, worldwide connection of documents or web pages. Each
        page may contain links to other pages anywhere in the world. The pages can be retrieved and viewed by using
        browsers of which internet explorer, Netscape Navigator, Google, Chrome, etc are the popular ones. The browser
        fetches the page requested interprets the text and formatting commands on it, and displays the page, properly
        formatted, on the screen.
        <br>The basic model of how the web works are shown in the figure below. Here the browser is displaying a web
        page on the client machine. When the user clicks on a line of text that is linked to a page on the abd.com
        server, the browser follows the hyperlink by sending a message to the abd.com server asking it for the page.

    <h3>Working of WWW: </h3>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
        and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

        A Web browser is used to access webpages. Web browsers can be defined as programs which display text, data,
        pictures, animation and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using
        software interface provided by Web browsers. Initially Web browsers were used only for surfing the Web but now
        they have become more universal. Web browsers can be used for several tasks including conducting searches,
        mailing, transferring files, and much more. Some of the commonly used browsers are Internet Explorer, Opera
        Mini, Google Chrome.
